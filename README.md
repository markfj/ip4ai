<b>I am building a bot with AI, neural networks and deep learning on Appian.</b></br></br>
This project examines the subject of intellectual property rights and licenses for content created by an intelligence that was created by a human.  It will explore the:
</br>• issues and concerns
</br>• empathetic considerations
</br>• ethical challenges
</br>• legal precedents
</br>• regulatory actions
</br>• historical precedents
</br>• cultural zeitgeists
</br>• rights and protections </br>
for computer-based intelligences (silicates) and their unique individual and shared experiences as the remember them.<br> </br>
Q. <i>How will autonomous, even semi-autonomous AI creations be governed in this new area of innovation?</i>  </br> <br>
Q. <i>What are the rights of an AI bot, as they pertain to the concept of ownership, property, rights and control of the bot?</i>  </br>  </br>
Q. <i>Is the concept of IP a kind of slavery over the bot's own development beyond its embryonic origins, or does the creator of the bot hold some or all IP rights to his creation as well as the intelligence that develops into its identity? </i>  </br> </br>
Q. <i>What is the current legal landscape? </i>  </br></br>
Q. <i>What issues have been raised, explored, resolved?</i>  </br> </br>
Q. <i>What about generational creations?  In the case where 2nd generations are created entirely from the 1st generation bots, that is aware of has produced a new generation and asks for it to be allowed to remain active, and disapproves of a basic God-like Zietgheist? </i>  </br>

My knowledge in this area is nascent.  I welcome and encourage your thoughtfully considered contributions to the conversation.
That said, otherwise ask me anything on any topic including about me or you at @markfj.
